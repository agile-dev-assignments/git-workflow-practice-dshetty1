This article is about the probability of Apple entering into the car market with the release of the Apple car. There have been reports of deals made between Apple and Kia, as well as Apple and Hyundai. Apple has also poached top level executives from Porsche, Google's Waymo, and Tesla.

Even with all this internal development, it's still extremely difficult to figure out if Apple will enter the car market in the coming years. Apple is very secretive with all of their research and development, often developing many products that consumers will never see. Additionally, there is th question of if the move makes sense in a business context. Apple earns good margins on their software and hardware products, while car manufacturer margins are notoriously low. It makes much more sense for Apple to align themselves with an existing manufacturer and develop the software for that company's self-driving car.
